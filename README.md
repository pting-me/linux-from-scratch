# DEPRECATED

I wrote these scripts back in 2013 (it is currently 2022), and I think it's about time to archive this repository.
If you happen upon this repository, please understand that part of the motivation behind
[Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) is to encourage people to write out shell code by hand
to better understand the internals of how Linux is built. I wrote these scripts in order to cheat my way out of doing that.

I don't have the motivation to update this, nor do I think you should use the same approach. However, I'll still leave it
open to the public.

I don't really remember what version of LFS was written for, but the host OS was Debian 7. I'm a much more seasoned
developer today, with better versioning practices (hopefully).
